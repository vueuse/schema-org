title: Augment WebPage @type
---

Setting a specific WebPage type can be a useful way to tell Google about the content of the page.

Since WebPage should be setup through with [schema inheritance](/guide/how-it-works.html#schema-inheritance),
you can replace the WebPage entry using `defineWebPage`.

Schema automation is also done on the page route to try and guess the ideal page type if you need to manually set if you can see 
the below example.

See [WebPage](/api/schema/webpage) for more information.

## Example

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
useSchemaOrg([
  // make the current page an AboutPage
  defineWebPage({
    '@type': 'AboutPage'
  }),
])
</script>
```
